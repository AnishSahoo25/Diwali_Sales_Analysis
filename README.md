# This project involves analyzing data related to road traffic accidents (RTA) using Python and pandas. The dataset, extracted from an Excel file, includes information about accident victims, such as age, gender, alcohol consumption, helmet usage, and site of death. The analysis addresses various questions, including the number of children fatalities, alcohol consumption patterns, and the impact of helmet usage. Hypotheses are formulated and tested, exploring factors like age, alcohol influence, and the relationship between rider/pillion deaths. Data visualization techniques, such as bar plots and heatmaps, are employed to present insights. Additionally, logistic regression modeling is applied to predict survival outcomes based on explanatory variables.
